# u2vis - Universal Unity Visualization Framework

This is a universal framework for information visualizations in Unity developed at the Interactive Media Lab Dresden. The framework supports a vast number of visualizations, like 2D and 3D bar charts, scatter plots, line charts, pie charts, and parallel coordinates. The framework is build to be simple to understand as well as easy to extend and customize.
It can be used in purely 2D environments, but also 3D ones. Furthermore its ready to be used in Augmented Reality (e.g. with the MS HoloLens 1 or 2) and Virtual Reality.
